#### Poutsch

In January 2012, Etienne Adriaenssen, Felix Winckler and Melchior Sch√∂ller got together in an attic somewhere in Paris and started Poutsch. The project grew from the frustration that there was no easy way to collect, express and understand opinions online.

The trio bootstrapped the company for three months, eventually moving to the Paris based accelerator Le Camping where they built a scalable version of their product. In January 2013, the team moved to New York City. They are currently growing to further pursue their vision to empower people and organizations through opinion questions.
